<p>Problem</p>
<p>Some users have big screens. For them 10 expense are really less.They can easily see somewhere around 20 -40 expenses a page.</p>
<p>Some users have small screens. For them 10 expense is a lot of congestion. They can see only 5- 8 expenses.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Deliverable</p>
<ol>
	<li>
		Let the user set how many expense he wants to see on the screen. Something like

			>this</a
		>
	</li>
	<li>Store that preference in local storage. so that this config gets saved for the user.</li>
	<li>When he refreshes the page he should be able to see the same number of expenses</li>
</ol>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Check hint 1 if stuck. This is pretty easy.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Push the code to git and upload the commit iD</p>
